What did I do wrong? 10/10 Rejection (Please help),4cyr9w,d1mxqru,d1msz1m,"Speaker(id: 'three_martini_lunch', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","It is complicated because it is comparing apples and oranges.

First, most international schools have different GPA scales and different ways students are evaluated. Often this depends on both the country and the institution.

Because of this, international students prepare for the GRE much better, and consequently have higher GRE scores. In practice, this has little predictive value. However, for international students from some countries, GPA and GRE must be nearly perfect especially for the schools the OP applied to. I can pretty much say that if you are not at the top of your class from the best university in your country, you will not get in to these schools.

For GRE and GPA remember that most programs take only a handful of students. But even our program receives hundreds of international applicants and we are a typical mid-level R1 STEM program. If your GRE and GPA are not in the top 5-15% of applicants you won't get into our program. For where I was a post-doc and grad student, this would be in the 0.1% or so. 

Research experience is much different, but this is what we look at most. (Co) Authorship on papers in international journals is usually the differentiator. Letters from faculty in most countries are effectively useless. They rarely provide any information about how good the student is.

Statements of purpose are also looked at critically. If you have an outstanding TOEFEL, but your statement is poorly written, your application will end up in the No pile very quickly. Generic, or non-genuine statements also do not help much. I can't tell you what a good statement looks like, as this is personal to the student, but I can tell you that over 80% of statements of purpose from international applicants that I review are generic, have typos and grammatical errors and/or show no signs of why the student is passionate about science and our program.

For places as the OP applied to, the only way to get in as an international student to is be in the top 1% of your undergrad class at the top university of your country, with lots of research experience, excellent English skills and a demonstrated aptitude for science. The OP is missing the GPA for sure, the TOEFEL suggests moderate to poor English skills compared to other applicants. Failing a class or two would definitely put the applicant in the No pile for a videoconference interview.

Assuming this information is correct, this applicant would be borderline for our program. Performance in classes/GPA is just too low to take the risk on the student. I would give this student a moderate chance of our program having done a videoconference interview since there is reserach expereince and co-authorship on a Cell press journal article (I would suspect this is what the OP meant, not Cell itself). If the student didn't show signs of passion for a specific reserach program(s) in their statement, then it is unlikely anyone on the committee would take the time to interview the applicant as it is time consuming and difficult to do this, especially if you have no idea what the applicant is interested in. If the applicant in the OP didn't get into programs after a videoconference, then it is hard to say for sure, but most likely a combination of English skills, not being prepared, or not having an idea of what they want to do. It is hard to say, but with the limited information about the GRE verbal and TOEFEL, I would suspect at least some issues with English skills came up in the interviews.",1459603495,603

It also sounds very tacky to start the essay about your Cell paper and to mention the times ranking of your school. 

Other thoughts: In your CV the journal name is ""Cell"", not ""Cell Press"". Make your personal statement about you rather than about your research again. Have someone fluent in English read your statement (while the English is pretty good you miss out on proper number and tense a few times). If you really can program in those languages, it would be good to show some examples at a github repo.

Just to be sure I understand you correctly, are you using that percentage range to refer to the percentage of admits each year? If so, I think you're understating it greatly. I'm using this statistical profile from an institution comparable to many that OP applied to for reference: http://gsas.yale.edu/sites/default/files/department-files/bbs.pdf

Of course, if I misread your claim, this isn't relevant. If I didn't, however, you'll see that the % of admission tends to hover around 8-10%.

Aside from that, however, I'm strongly in favor of applying to the highest-ranked programs in one's field. GPA and GRE certainly aren't pulling OP down--I say this based on knowing many current students with comparable numbers. I can't say further than that since I'm not in STEM, so I don't know how specific the criteria of previous experience and relevance of projects get. However, I would be willing to bet that OP would do well to work on those aspects rather than focus on the numbers.

An important difference between STEM grad admissions between Canada and USA is that in USA, you're very much applying to the department first, and then you pick an advisor after the fact. Even if you have an advisor in mind, and vice versa, the admissions committee has you approve you first.

This is different in Canada - it's extremely dependent on the advisor. If an advisor wants to hire you as a grad student, you have *very* close to a 100% chance of getting in. When I applied to PhD programs in Canada, I talked with a potential advisor first and confirmed that they wanted me. Actually applying after that point was just a formality. This was also true for 100% of my ~10 friends/colleagues who were also applying at the same time (to various Canadian schools).

As for alternate PhD/Masters offers: This is also a subtle difference between USA and Canada. In the States (in STEM), it's common to be either admitted straight to a Master's program (because to applied to such), *or* a PhD-track program. You can 'master out' of a PhD program as well, in many cases. Many STEM PhDs are admitted to a PhD-track program straight out of a Bachelor's degree, and getting the Master's degree often becomes optional.

In Canada, it's far more common for people to apply first to a terminal Master's program, with the intent to pursue a PhD. The majority of PhD students will already have a Master's, and many will do a Master's and PhD at separate schools. You can definitely apply straight to a PhD-track program out of a Bachelor's degree, but Canadian schools tend to stipulate that they only offer this to 'exceptional candidates' (whatever that means). Instead of seeking out an alternate offer between MSc/PhD, you should just seek out an advisor at the school and ask if you're better suited for the PhD or MSc program. If they want you as a MSc/PhD student, then you're basically in (assuming it's a Canadian school).",1460297119,351

Without knowing the details of your transcripts, it sounds as if you re-took several bio classes, and in one case you reached the limits of the re-take policy to you also have a ""D"" on your transcript.

Since these programs are saying you are in the bottom 25% of applicants, this would suggest that this is indeed true. If you only have 4 possible schools, I'm not sure what additional art classes are going to do to improve your chances, when your fundamentals, your GPA and undergrad grades aren't up to the caliber needed to gain admittance. I can't say for medical illustration, but I sit on biology admissions and I can say that we do not accept students with ""D""s in any of the bio classes, and we especially do not for upper division courses (of which includes cell biology). Consider that we are a mid-tier R1 biology program as well.

You best bet would be to find a regular biology MS program and go from there. But even then, I'm not sure that this is the answer for you as you would then be applying for a second MS program in a more specialized field. This puts you completing your first MS degree in 2-3 years, before you even start medical illustration grad school.

I actually retook the ones I had bad grades in (such as Cell Bio) and managed to get better grades in all of them. However, because it was upper division, my university had a rule that I am not allowed to replace upper division class grades, only average it out. I retook Cell Bio the subsequent semester and managed to improve with a B, but the D is forever on there, and I know nothing I can do now can take it off. My other retaken classes show they have been grade-replaced.

&gt; Since these programs are saying you are in the bottom 25% of applicants, this would suggest that this is indeed true. 

This was true for only one of my schools. I was lucky enough at another school to be considered for interview.

Most schools indicate if classes were retaken or not. For grade replacement it is common that the class is listed on your transcript with no grade and then listed later with the replacement grade. Some schools are hard and indicate your original grade and the replacement grade. A common policy is similar to yours, one of the most common ones I have seen is 4 possible re-takes, only 1-2 can be in upper division classes. Grade replacement is usually a bit of a mis-nomer in that is means retaking the class so that the new one is part of your GPA, not the old one, and again is typically limited to about 4 classes. After this, both tries at the class count toward your GPA. It is rare that the old classes are completely missing from your transcript and only happens when students do some sort of ""semester bankrupting"" where an entire semester magically disappears, but usually requires and administrative hearing and justification (e.g. Major illness, personal crisis etc.).

So, that being said, you transcript says (again not having it in front of me) that you retook in the neighborhood of 4 classes, when the policy could not apply you went from a D to a B in an upper division course.

I don't know about medical illustration, but a 152Q/152V are not amazing, but not bad GRE scores. These GRE scores are not going to get you noticed, but not gong to get you rejected. It probably is not worth re-taking the GRE, unless medical illustration schools weigh the GRE heavily (I have no idea, we do not weigh is all that strongly).

I would follow up with the school you had an interview with to see where you stand/stood. If there ar only 4 schools out there I would expect that if one schools is telling you that you are in the bottom 25% then this is likely true at all schools as the same applicant pool is applying to all schools. You might have ranked slightly higher at the school you were interviewed at or were an easy candidate to interview. We take people with bumps on their transcripts all the time, but that is usually limited to lower division courses or course re-takes. We almost never take students with bumps in upper division courses as these are indicative of how they will do in graduate classes.

Anyway, this is long winded, but basically you got moderate interest from one school that did not materialize into an offer, one school indicating that you are in the bottom 25% of applicants. Taking an honest look at these facts just by averaging would suggest you are in the bottom half to 2/3 of candidates at this limited pool of applicants with the big red flag being your transcript and GPA. Again, I'm not sure what additional art portfolio additions would really do to alleviate this issue, maybe it would, maybe it would not. However, with only 4 options for schools and being in your situation if you don't make it in next year, I would have a backup plan in place for your future career.",1460303107,535

You keep saying that this D is what is killing your GPA.  I had two D's, many C's, and more than my fair share of B's, but in my major, where it counted, my lowest mark was a C+, and the rest were mostly A's.  I got denied my first year, but was successful in my second Masters attempt and was successful in my first PhD attempt.  I think you're over-relying on this D as the one anchor dragging down your entire application.  

While I do agree that it was amazing that the school gave you feedback, regardless if it was negative, I still fail to see the connection.  To put it into perspective, a B is a failure in grad school.  So I can see why that may be alarming to an adcom department, especially in an upper year course.  I think /u/three_martini_lunch has it right, as much as you don't want to hear it, it's probably your entire profile, not just one grade.  Personally, I wouldn't waste my time on art classes, unless you really feel like you stink at drawing and this is the part that is holding you back.  I would go back to school for a year, even at a community college, and take the most rigorous science program you can that is linked to what you want to do.  Chances are they are going to have a cell biology course that will be maybe a bit easier than a university one, but will show your ability to excel in the program.  However, you need to ace this course, like A+, just killed it in order to override your uni grades.  Combine that with taking the other courses in the programs to boost your GPA in your extra-lap year will help, hopefully.

D's in non-major classes will raise eyebrows and probably drop you down the ranking for interviews but *may* not exclude you.

C's are not problem in non-major classes, possibly ok in lower division courses, we typically do not like to see any C's in upper division courses.  

Why? Because in grad school you have to maintain a 3.0/B, and many schools will not allow a course with less than a 3.0/B count toward your degree. If you can't do this as an undergrad then why would you do any better when you are under more stress, the classes are more difficult and the amount of material is much greater?

I'm going to be a student at Hopkins' medical illustration program in the fall and I can offer a little perspective from teachers and others that have applied to these programs too. 

I do not think that the one D in cell bio will be a deal breaker at all. From what I understand, the schools consider the portfolio the most important piece of the application. Having a solid transcript certainly helps, but if the portfolio doesn't ""wow,"" the chances of an acceptance decrease. If you're going to add to it, I suggest some life drawing sessions. Showing a strong background in figures and basics of drawing is a must. If you have a strong interest in a subject matter (plants, birds, etc.) you might also make a few pieces just about that! In my interview I talked about a series of botanical pieces I had compiled into a book and the professors loved the outcome and idea. 

These programs are so so competitive that it's not unheard of to apply many times to get an acceptance. Just keep trying! Go to portfolio reviews before applications open and make sure that you take notes on what they say to improve. 

As for your cell bio grade, if you're really concerned you could try to write a little letter explaining the school policy and how you have retaken the class and done better in it! 

Your GRE score is fine for these schools and I don't think you need to do anything about it.

But if you do get rejected, once application season is over I would e-mail the graduate admissions offices and ask them about why they rejected your application. It could simply have been that there were way too many talented applicants and they couldn't accept everyone (this is very common), or they may have advice they can give you to strengthen your application for next time, if you decide to try once more. If it's something you really want to do, I recommend it. 

Secondly, are you applying to top schools or do you have ""safety"" schools as well? If you are applying to only high-ranked programs, it is worth looking into lower ranked programs as well, especially if they are known to offer funding. This is less common if you go the MA route but there are still some schools out there that do offer some kind of financial aid. 

Finally, I think you should really consider your end goals for grad school and think of an alternate route that can possibly get you there in case you aren't able to get into a school. Is there something in particular you'd like to do with your degree? 

(Also, you are never too old to attend grad school, so definitely don't worry about that.)

If I can be of any help just message me. I know this time is incredibly stressful, but all of us prospective grad students and students in general go through it, so do your best not to be too hard on yourself or blame yourself for any of this.",1457233447,279

Do you mind telling us what field you want to get a good job in?

I'm sure that you can make some connections and land a good job without a grad degree. To be honest, I think the things you're struggling with and the way you frame your situation are more of an impediment to your career goals than a masters.

You may have experienced failure everywhere, as you mentioned, but the unfortunate fact is that an attitude that you will fail is the biggest factor that contributes to failing more.

So don't give up on yourself: you are never too old for grad school, and there are definitely people over 28 in grad programs. Maybe saving some more money and setting goals in other parts of your life (that are achievable) will help you with this feeling of constantly struggling and failing at things.

* If your goal is to become a teacher or work outside of academia/industry but within the field of physics, I would say that you might consider very seriously going to this school. Having a Ph.D. is a big boost in a lot of areas, and for things not directly related to academia/industry, there ""where"" isn't as big of a factor.

* If academia is your goal (e.g. professor at a research university, permanent position at a national lab, etc.), then you should think very seriously about taking a year off – working your ass off on the pGRE, doing some sort of research, etc. – and reapplying next year. You're definitely not wrong in your assessment that, as a general rule, a select group of a few universities (the top 10 or 15 programs: MIT, Berkeley, Harvard, Caltech, etc.) seem to have a monopoly on sending physicists to tenured academic jobs.

* I honestly haven't the foggiest idea what would be the best course of action for industry, but I would be willing to bet it depends heavily on how close to physics/astronomy you want to be. In any case, though, name recognition can't hurt. 

My honest advice would be to think hard about what areas of your application you need to improve if you were to reapply, and then to think about how easily you might be able to improve these in the next ~9 months. 

For example, did you write a weak SoP or have a low pGRE score because you only took the test once and didn't study for it enough? Either of these are relatively easy to fix, given a month or two of concerted effort (of which you have 9 at your disposal). 

Or, another one: Do you have any meaningful research experience? ...in your desired graduate subfield? If the answer to either one of these is 'no', then how easily could you get work (presumably with someone from your undergrad institution) in the area this year? (This one could fall anywhere from 'easy' to 'very hard' on the spectrum of how readily it can be improved for your application.)

Once you have an idea of 1) how much you have to improve, and 2) how easy it is to improve these things in 9 months, I think you should stop and weigh how much you are willing to work over the next 9 months and the potential impact it could have on your career. This is also where your desired career goals come in: is it worth it to bust your ass for the next year to get into a better school for your PhD, or is just having your PhD going to set you apart enough?

**I'll leave you with this to keep in mind: you're going to work your ass off for the next 4–6 (...or 7, or 8, but hopefully not 9) years studying for a Ph.D, and we're talking hard work, so if spending one extra year of hard work now will make the next 4–8 years of your life substantially more rewarding (in terms of career outlook), then I think it's worth it.**",1458287389,530

Yeah, I have also thought really hard about whether attending graduate school is something that I really want to do, and I've decided that it is. Throughout undergrad I've applied myself in many many other ways except for school, just barely doing the average to keep up with classes. I've gained a lot of self improvement through all sorts of different ways, but that also means I didn't have enough time to spend on studying and sometimes would also miss classes. I don't regret doing what I did because I believe doing anything has its benefits later in life, and now I want to put everything else aside and just focus on learning for a while which led to my decision to apply for a master's degree. 

Point is, I finally have a good opportunity to drop everything that I've been doing and work on school alone, but graduate programs focus very strongly on how well you do academically in undergrad and there's no opportunity to prove myself to them beyond those aspects. 

I'm fine with spending more than two years in industry, but my question still stands: how do I prove to them that I can do well in their programs and how do I obtain LORs from my undergrad professors after being in industry for so long?",1459319738,223

You spend enough years in industry doing work relevant to the type of program you'd like to eventually enroll in until your undergraduate record and lack of strong academic LORs can be overlooked.

When people do poorly in undergrad but excel in their professional careers and apply with 6-10 years of experience, admissions are likely to believe the story that ""I didn't apply myself way back then, but I've worked hard and learned a lot since then and am now ready to take my studies seriously.""

As it stands now, I see two avenues for you: be more realistic and apply to more schools (read: aim lower; give up the fantasy of going to a Top 15 or even Top 30 program); or: focus on working and doing progressively more important/relevant work for the next half decade or so, then reapply.

1. A professor didn't invite any applicants to interview because his funding situation was unclear at the time; a couple of months after the visit day, he received news that a research grant was going to be funded, so he made a late admission offer to a great applicant (who accepted).

2. A professor had already met with and quasi-interviewed an applicant at a conference beforehand, so he decided to invite other applicants to the visit day. The conference-interviewed applicant eventually got an admission offer (and accepted).

Are there jobs at those places that you do qualify for?  Once you get in the door, moving around is much easier than landing the dream job.  For example, get in and start associating with the folks who work on what you like.  Help them out with things.  Prove that you're a performer and an asset to their team.  Then, make an internal move into that team.

I know it is hard but try to put yourself out there a bit every day... these are some things that have helped me over the years.

1) Go to coffee shops to do your work; chances are you'll eventually meet people that are in a similar scenario as you are.. great self-esteem boost + you get to enjoy coffee.

2) Start doing some crazy (fun) stuff like going to a rock-climb gym; The mental and physical pressure will make you forget everything that is going on around you... 

3)Volunteer a tiny bit. This can be a bit hard for you because of social interactions... but I do think it would help you raise some morale. I personally have a preference for either animal shelters or conservation easements..

4) Do some yoga on your own in the morning and after social events.

5) Realize that every second you're not trying to improve yourself is a second wasted. Get to work. You'll get past your anxiety in no time. ",1490793740,173

I was able to fund it (tuition+stipend) by teaching, but there are various ways of securing funding in my department. Like you, most people in my field (including many of my professors) do a master's before the PhD. I chose to do one because, even though I had a good undergraduate record, my professors suggested that doing a master's would get me into a much better PhD program. I didn't apply to PhD programs outright so I'm not sure if things would have been different.

If you are really set on pursuing an academic career, I would suggest, without hesitation, doing a funded masters! Really, the only ""drawback"" is that it will take two years of your life. And quite honestly, many 23-24 year olds are still figuring out what they want to do, so I don't feel like I'm accomplishing less than my peers. I definitely don't feel like I wasted my time. 

I've benefited from my degree in so many ways -- I became more knowledgable about my field, I got to do more research, I built better relationships with professors, I gained a better idea of what my research interests were, I got used to the various aspects of graduate school (from conferences to living on a stipend), I was able to put together a better writing sample than anything I did as an undergrad, and frankly, I grew up. 

While I can't say 100% that a master's degree will be more helpful in your particular field than work experience, I really do believe that mine strengthened my application considerably (I also applied to 8 schools of varying selectiveness and I've had 4 interviews and 1 acceptance without an interview so far).

Assuming they used a system like CollegeNet that we use, we do a few rounds of classification and ranking of applications. We go ahead and reject the bottom half or so and then move on to more thorough review of those remaining. For us this is based mostly off of GPA and GRE (we reject pretty much everyone with a GPA below 3.2 these days as this is our minimum), GRE does factor in to a small degree. We also use the recommender scoring matrix from CollegeNet to do a second round of cuts (e.g. if more than one recommender puts you less than 10% across the board you will probably also be cut). After that, we do a check of the applications in the cut pile to make sure we aren't missing something, and then send out rejections notices. This process takes about a week with the goal of getting down to the applications that require more extensive review. After the initial cut we assign committee members to review certain ones. Those that we are serious about do not receive rejection notices until all spots are filled, usually around April 15th. 

Note that we do this process before the deadline as well, so we already have a queue of applications set to be rejected or further reviewed. Usually we check these once per week starting in November (Dec 1 deadline).",1454479347,245

Ask profs if they will share their graduate students' emails with you and talk to them. Look at their CVs if you can find them.

UBC isn't really a ""good"" school in the US. McGill. Concordia. Ryerson in Ontario are the typical ones we hear about in the States. I don't agree with that. I think unless a school is terrible, it is a good school (lest it's for profit).

Your GRE scores certainly didn't disqualify you. Your credentials are pretty solid. You just didn't actively get yourself into the program. I'm sure the people who got into the open spots inserted themselves into the spots. If one of those candidates didn't hear back from a professor, they picked up the phone and called. They probably tracked down who actually had funding and didn't say to themselves ""professors are busy."" They wrote emails that said ""Professor XYZ said you have funding and are looking to pick up a student in your lab next Fall. I am that student and here's why."" My advice, if you decide to reapply next year, is look further and wider for programs. Don't limit yourself to only a handful of professors you contact.

Some are more laid back and care about the students having work life balance. Most people would work best with one of these environments, so you should figure out what kind of environment you really want.

In some programs, the social lives and networking for the students matter a lot too. In some, they don't care about that as much. They're essentially hiring you for the next 6 years so they want to make sure you have something additional to bring to the table, not just academically. Maybe the student environment is one where they really like it when people get involved in, say, student government, organizing retreats, organizing student trips or whatever. Maybe they prefer if their students spend more time in labs. You don't really know these things until you go there to visit.

There's also the chance that if you truly didn't 'fit', even if your academic qualifications were strong, you might be miserable for 6 years. ""Fit"" is an incredibly important factor.

Think about the labs you've worked in through and after school. Was there one you liked more than the others? What did that lab have over others?

It's important to be genuine and show that you know how you're supposed to behave.

Frequently, someone says something that angers/irritates you and, as jllunsfo said, you get very defensive and (to be honest) not very fun to talk to. I think jllunsfo and hlynn117 are correct in pointing out your lack of maturity, and I'll add that you seem very quick to get angry when people disagree with you. This is my honest impression.

Now, I'm not saying this to say you're a bad person or anything like that. I'm sure you're a wonderful person most of the time, but realize that if multiple people on two different websites have the same responses when talking to you... that should tell you something about how you come off to people. They may not say it to your face, but you *are* getting feedback on your behavior. It's up to you now to take this feedback and decide how you are going to use it. If you take it to heart and do some introspection to grow as a person (in other words, to become more mature), I would guess that you would strengthen your application significantly. And if you can do that WHILE working for a year or two as a lab tech (as others have suggested), I would guess that you'd make an excellent candidate. ",1427324181,258

But I could certainly say that if they're open to it I'd love to know more about what projects their lab is currently working on (since publications usually lag a couple years behind)... or ask a specific question like, I read x study and was interested, have you considered following up by studying y, I'd be interested in doing that?

In terms of a working idea, say I talk about wanting to do something that's in line with my undergraduate thesis (looked at attachment and abuse) and I say I want to look at sibling relationships and see if they act as protective against developing psychopathology in the context of abuse. Too specific? Just right? I just don't want to nail myself down too strictly, because I am open to a lot.

Sorry for all the questions, I'm just really concerned about irritating profs or schools when I contact them. For example, I sent a brief (5-6 sentences) email expressing interest to one prof and she seemed incredibly irritated that I contacted her at all; I looked and the school didn't have any rules about that. It's so hard to tell what the etiquette is and what profs will prefer what when you really don't know the person you're talking to.",1517847569,294

Yeah, definitely needed to focus more on the school and what I want to do there. I am going to start very early, redrafting my statements, and maybe get some actual profs to look at it.

(MA/PhD - clinical psychology),7v9ouh,dts8gzj,dtrwdfq,"Speaker(id: 'GreenEyedTrombonist', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","How different is the research of each faculty member at your programs? There should be some overlap in case a specific prof can't take you, so I don't really see a problem with emailing more than one (I'd probably email only one at a time, wait to see what their response is, then move on to the next, and definitely wouldn't email more than two). Just make sure you are not demanding, thank them for their time in advance, and have a question or two that you are actually interested in knowing the answer to. It could be asking to discuss the program or their current work or could be more specific about your particular research interests. 

I don't think that's too specific a topic. You can connect that to professor research interests, show you're open to methodologies, theoretical frameworks, etc. My topic of research is fairly niche (looking at a specific aspect of politics on a specific social media platform), but I was able to connect that project to at least three faculty at each of my programs (I have a rule to only apply where I can see strong connections with multiple faculty). I would usually have one faculty I really wanted as my PoI and another two that worked in some aspect of my research interest and could contribute methodological or theoretical foundations. Not sure about clinical, but generally you aren't just there for your PoI. You also need a committee of at least three professors to approve your thesis, so it's important to identify more than one person potentially interested in your work.

So, here's the thing about irritating profs. If the department doesn't have something set against it (or encourages it) and a prof gets mad at you, do you really want to work with that person? Remember, this isn't just you trying to get into a place, it's you picking your fulltime+ work environment for the next 4-8 years of your life. An angry response gives you just as much (potentially more) information about working with a professor as a nice response. 

However, if you are really concerned about the etiquette, reach out to the DGS with broader questions first. They can then indicate whether you should contact a professor (and that gives you a good lead-in for your prof email- ""I was speaking with so-and-so and they suggested I ask you..."") and they can give you a lot of the basic information so you aren't bogging down a prof with procedure questions.

A lot of times it was a struggle to find people where a research idea would fit into two labs, and basically impossible to find where a project would fit all three. That's taking into account that not every prof is taking on students too, so a lot of times I would find two that fit and only one was taking students, so I'd find another that wasn't so similar. I applied at four places in-province and one outside of it that's nearby (live on a border), and I made sure to only apply to places where I knew I'd be interested in working with some of the profs there. Any of those schools I would have been very happy to go to. It's just like... for example, one school I applied to I listed people who looked at emotion development in children, self-harm in adolescents, and effects of childhood abuse. That's about as close as I could get. Another place, one prof looked at youth accessing mental health care services, and another at depression in children and adolescents. So how exactly do you bridge those three things when being specific? It just seems like such a bizarre process to me, I truly am lost. I think in terms of contacting people though, I definitely could ask more specific questions this time around.

You are certainly right about the irritating professors thing. I actually didn't end up applying there because she was the only professor I could see myself working with, and based on that response I figured it was pointless anyway.",1517859961,283

I've never heard of undergraduates publishing in humanities disciplines, at least in the US (I'm not counting undergraduate journals, which aren't at all the same thing). Students in my discipline (not English, but similar) typically don't have their first real publication until they are advanced grad students, working on or about to start working on their dissertation. 

If you have some level of competency in another language, you could try applying to a program where you can teach English abroad. Most English PhD programs require some knowledge of a foreign language anyway, and you could get an idea of how you like teaching. Or you could do some other kind of writing/editing-heavy job if you want to keep honing your skills. But the kind of research jobs in STEM that only require a bachelor's don't really exist in the humanities, so other than working on your application itself (GRE, SoP, etc.), there's no ""golden ticket"" job you can have for a year that will make you more appealing.

Although related, your degrees technically aren't English degrees, so there's always that minor disadvantage when applying to a PhD program, and always that potential question of, do they have the proper training and background for this program?

Because of this, when people ask about switching fields on this subreddit, the standard advice is to make your application doubly strong - usually with research experience. 

I know research experience in the humanities is harder to come by - after all, we don't have labs and many, if not most, of the projects undertaken by academics will be solo-projects - but I'd suggest looking for something. Likewise, I'd also examine how your current application discusses your research experience: presumably you had some for your master's degree, but is there anything else? When applying to a research program you have to be able to demonstrate that you are capable of research, and as you haven't addressed it, I'm not sure if you're lacking in that area, or if you may have neglected to mention it on your application, just as you neglected it in this post.",1519423528,203

This would be a good time to reevaluate what type of work you want to do. You don't have to love your job, most people don't. But something that stimulates your mind, isn't boring, and provides a good work/life balance is typically a good fit. 

If you're really keen on this field though, you can look into getting a Master degree abroad. It's typically cheaper. You most likely can't focus on US Economics abroad, however many universities offer a master in Econ. 

I assume you'll have an econ degree. Have you thought about going into consulting? Health economics is quite a good paying field, there are environmental economic consultants too.

Economic history is dying, or at least it's becoming something else. I would be interested to know what specifically you mean when you say ""20th century US economic history"", especially because you also mention having ""zero quantitative skills"" in another comment. To me, it may be that there's a more popular/appealing specialty that can answer similar questions or fit your interests. As it is, economic history is sort of... antiquated. It's been transformed in the crucible of cultural history.

If I were you, I would really work on figuring out what it is that interests you. Ignore labels. Look through the major journals for American history, see what other people are talking about. What are their methods? Is this the sort of stuff you're interested in, if applied in a different context? It's also very hard to be an Americanist without looking at race, gender, or sexuality. Not impossible, but hard. Are these part of your research interests? Furthermore, the most important change right now in the discipline is the ""global turn,"" that is, overcoming the national paradigm and looking at how non-national (which is what ""global"" means, evidently) processes impacted localized events. Are your interests ""global""? Can you introduce this perspective somehow?

It sounds like you have the opposite problem that most BA applicants have--you seem to be clinging too hard to this specific field when it doesn't really sound like you're even really in that specific field. There's so much to this discipline and you have so many options that could be even more interesting, and that can still work with economic sources/methods.

History is brilliant because it's so expansive, it allows for so much creativity... don't pigeonhole yourself.

Historical materialism is the methodological approach of Marxist historiography that focuses on human societies and their development over time, claiming that they follow a number of observable tendencies. This was first articulated by Karl Marx (1818–1883) as the materialist conception of history. It is principally a theory of history according to which the material conditions of a society's way of producing and reproducing the means of human existence or, in Marxist terms, the union of its productive capacity and social relations of production, fundamentally determine its organization and development.

Historical materialism looks for the causes of developments and changes in human society in the means by which humans collectively produce the necessities of life.

***

**Base and superstructure**

In Marxist theory, human society consists of two parts: the base (or substructure) and superstructure. The base comprises the forces and relations of production (e.g. employer–employee work conditions, the technical division of labour, and property relations) into which people enter to produce the necessities and amenities of life. The base determines society's other relationships and ideas to comprise its superstructure, including its culture, institutions, political power structures, roles, rituals, and state.

I don’t mean to be harsh, but as someone in the field you’re interested in, it’s clear to me why you’re not getting in anywhere. 

I’m a Americanist and my dissertation is on nineteenth century banking. In my department we have lots of people who work on topics you’re interested in, including one person who is doing a dissertation on American and European banking in the inter war period, so I can assure you that the field isn’t dead. 

The number one reason you’re probably not getting looked at is because you’re using the wrong terms to describe your work. When you tell most banking historians that you do “economic history,” they hear that you’re an economist who does quantitative  work. Moreover, historians and economic historians are at war right now- just look at the Olmsted and Rhodes vs baptist  controversies. (I know this is a nineteenth century example, but it’s the field I know best) What you’re talking about is the history of capitalism or the history of finance, which is a totally different ball game. It’s basically like you’re announcing that you’re a die hard trump supporter while trying to get the democratic nomination. At the same time, Marxist methodologies are widely seen as not quite a good fit for studying markets from a social or cultural perspective. Instead, we tend to see them as one tool in a larger toolbox. Class analysis isn’t gone from history, it’s just changed. 

For more on the split, I recommend Levy’s article in the 2017 winter volume of the AHR, and on historical materialism you need that lipartito article on it. I can recommend lots of other readings if that would be helpful. 

Now, the problem isn’t just that you’re saying that you do something that you don’t, but for a potential advisor, the fact that you’re using the wrong term is a big red flag. In fed school, you mostly have to teach yourself. As a potential advisor, I would find it very concerning that you haven’t yet picked up on some of the basic splits in the discipline, and it would make me worry about how you would handle comps and so on.

You are basically me! I'm an international student with a background in EE. My GPA is between 3.7 to 4.0, depending on which school you ask. I applied to McGill, Waterloo, Ottawa and Queen's. I don't have any research experience but do have extensive work experience in the area I wanted to study: Computer Vision. What mattered the most was my resume and reaching out to professors. I didn't take the GRE.

My resume was catered for Computer Vision i.e. I listed all the relevant skills I have in the field at the top and emphasized the keywords by making them bold (for ex: **Neural Networks**). Next I listed my professional experience and in the last section I basically dressed up my undergrad's final year project as research experience; which was also in Computer Vision. In my essay, I expanded on three projects I had done in area but I also catered the essay to each school, as best as I could.

I got into Queen's (funded), Waterloo (promised funding 1-2 months) and Ottawa (no funding). I initially didn't get into Queen's but the school emailed me a while later stating if I was still interested. It was a very generous offer but I said no as I had gotten in touch with a professor at Waterloo who said he will transfer me over to a thesis based program in 1-2 months (he's waiting for some funding to come through).

My suggestion is that you polish your resume because grad school applications for Canada are a lot like applying for a job. You should followup to potential advisors every 2-3 weeks. I hope your emails aren't too long, mine were 2-3 short paragraphs. If you can have publications by the time you apply then you should be OK.

It doesn't have to.

I'm sorry for your current state, but all is not lost. Far from it.

If you've just graduated, you're _very_ young with _plenty_ of years to forge whatever path you'd like - within reason, but yes, CS is still very much available to you.

As long as classes are available, good grades are still available. If you were to take a year of classes and ace them (As; Bs aren't really much use to you at this point), your total GPA will rise. (The GPA you graduated with won't change, but that's not all they ask for. You'll prove you can do the work successfully).

What is it that you found to be an (the) obstacles to doing well in your classes? How can you address them in the future?

You know this, but I'll mention it again - the issue with the grades is that you've not shown you're capable with undergrad topics (or focus/commitment), so they're going to be less likely to put you in a situation where you'll struggle, esp. if there are those who don't seem to struggle (at least on paper) to grant admission. You may be extremely capable - they just don't know that from your record.

Take a good look at those issues. If you can address them and overcome them - proving so with some great grades over the year - you'll probably be more successful the next time you apply.

Allow yourself time to feel bad - it's understandable - then get up, dust yourself off, decide what you _really_ want to do, then figure out what steps you need to take to do that.

Life isn't over. Far from it.

I literally asked people the week before the exams what the text books were, got my hands on them (once I actually had to take pictures of an entire book because I couldn't find one to buy) and I would study 15 hours a day - pull all nighters and barely pass classes.

I turned things around my last couple of semesters. Went from all D's and F's to B's and A's. I thought this upward trend would also help, but guess not. But I know how **not** to do it again, so at least that's something. I'm gonna show up to my classes, do the work required throughout the semester, and get ready by studying up some of the classes I barely passed using MIT lectures, so I'm not playing catch up during classes.

The ADHD thing often figures into mental health issues; one reason being that the frontal lobe is where executive function governs our emotions. Without a healthy regulator, emotions can run amok. 

Also, people tend to have poor goal/behavior connections. Long-term goals disappear during an impulsive moment, even just to sleep in ""just this once.""

I'm sorry your family doesn't support medical ADHD intervention, but God (the universe, evolution, whatever) hasn't created the perfect family, yet, so they may simply be wrong about what's best for you in this case. According to you, ADHD seems to have fettered you, big time.

Trying to continue on as you have - probably with some ""I just need to try harder/get organized/be more disciplined"" is unlikely going to be a successful strategy. You've seen its effects.

Of course, I don't know you and don't know the extent to which/ways in which ADHD manifests itself for you, but without addressing this before proceeding forward may produce the same results you have now, along with the same disappointment/discouragement.

You didn't know that not going to class, not learning the material as you went but instead cramming at the last minute, never handing in assignments, etc. wasn't _the way to do things_?

Again, I don't know you, so please forgive me if I sound insensitive. Just trying to put a mirror up to your statements for you. 

Also, I don't know the degree to which the ADHD you mentioned has manifested, but those are classic ADHD behaviors - not connecting long-term consequences/goals w/ immediate actions (or lack thereof).

Again, I'd recommend some _other_ intervention/support beyond ""I'll just do it differently, this next time."" Universities in the U.S. have all sorts of support systems/coaches/therapists/etc. (even without using the medication your family seems to oppose) which can help you succeed academically.

Taking rejections pretty hard,1v9wna,ceq5pop,1v9wna,"Speaker(id: 'PoliteMeow', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","Don't psych yourself out. You need to assess and make sure that the programs you sought to be part of are reasonable for the background that you have. If you overshot and picked unrealistic programs (i.e. You are a community college graduate with a 2.7 GPA in english asking to get into MIT -- it is an exaggerated example, I know), you need to reassess what programs you are suited to. Programs look for someone that has a high likelihood of completing the program -- if you're lackluster, you must give them something to suppress any red flags that may come up. 

If you did choose programs that you're capable of filling (which I assume you did), I hope that you get a positive response soon. You may need to review the strength of the materials that you are submitting to programs. If you do not have a well-rounded portfolio, you need to be able to talk to someone within the department (like a department chair) you are applying. Ask them how someone in your situation (explain it concisely without making excuses) should compensate for whatever it is that you may be lacking (test scores, GPA, extracurricular activities, volunteer work, etc.). Many times it can be addressed in your statement. The program I applied to required higher GRE scores that I had and I had no time to retake the exam before the due date. I contacted the department chair and had a candid discussion briefly outlining how I was suited to the department and how below expected scores were not derivative of my inability to complete the program. He advised me to address it in the letter I sent and to attach an additional writing sample of a study I published. This gave the committee enough to make a decision and it turned out positive.

However, (as I don't know the field you are hoping to work/study in. I am making this last recommendation based on advice I was given at different points in time when I was not getting positive results in my academic career.) you may need the corporate experience in order to better fill out your resume and make yourself more competitive. Do not see it as a sell out, if you are using it to propel your academic selectivity. Try to focus on expanding and improving yourself, don't be negative and gloat on the factors that have influenced decisions for others. You'll second guess everything in doing that. I dropped out of my undergrad in 2006, became an accountant for 5 years and now I am back on track heading for my PhD at the program I wanted to go to (previous story picks up here). It wasn't ideal, it wasn't what everyone else did, it wasn't what I wanted. But I made the decision to better myself, on paper and in experience because I knew that I wasn't getting where I wanted with what I had to offer (even though others had less and got more). 

I hope that you get positive feedback from a school, but if you don't you're still valuable and your dreams are not over. There are many paths to the same end. Some longer than others. ",1389798930,537

It sounds like you have some good research experience, it might be good to do a clinical internship. You can't boost your GPA but you can always study up and re-take the GRE (even if you already have good scores). You can revamp your personal statement and keep in touch with your recommenders (keep them up to date with your current activities). Unfortunately even doing these things won't guarantee you admission in the future – there really are just too many applicants for the number of available positions.

I hope that your interview goes well and that you will get accepted! But have you considered applying to a terminal Master's program in case you didn't get into any PhD programs? I chose to apply to an Experimental program and got accepted, and now I'm really glad I did. I've learned so much about psychology and research already and I've only been here for one semester. I'm also involved with a number of research projects so I plan on having multiple presentations and maybe even a manuscript or two under review by the time I have to apply to PhD programs again this year.

Master's programs typically have much later deadlines than PhD, so you have plenty of time to decide whether you want to do a terminal Master's or wait another year and re-apply. You have a stronger CV than me so I'm sure you wouldn't have much trouble finding a good program to get into.

A third-party background check costs money (the one we do on our students costs $64 per person).  The students know when we're doing it--in fact, we make them initiate the background check, and pay for it, and designate us to get the results.  So it's pretty unlikely that any schools will do one on you without you knowing about it.

That's not to say that nobody is ever going to Google your name, just out of curiosity.  I've done it when some applicant piqued my curiosity for some reason--it didn't have to be any indication of a criminal record, just something I wanted to know more about.  I wouldn't say that everybody does it, but I think it's somewhat common.  You'll have to assess how likely it is that a casual Google search will uncover your past.

I think you're right--if this first school rejected you when your application was still in the Admissions office or the Graduate School, or wherever it went first, then it was probably based on what you disclosed on your application.  If the other schools didn't ask, it's somewhat less likely that they will find out about your record.  Even schools that ask about a criminal record on the application don't necessarily turn down everybody who says they have one--most say they consider each one on a case-by-case basis (for example:  http://dailyuw.com/archive/2013/07/30/news/uw-adds-criminal-background-question-undergrad-admissions-application#.UvrCKvskTAE ).  But yeah, it could happen again.

If they're likely to find out anyway, it might be better if they heard it from you first.  But that's the dilemma--how likely are they to find out?  Who can say for sure?  That's a tough one, and not knowing you or your whole situation, I can't give you really good advice.

Does anyone else have anxiety about applying again after being rejected?,9g4lqt,e61npn2,9g4lqt,"Speaker(id: 'aptamer', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","I'm going to rehash the relevant part of the advice I gave [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/9esgfl/mit_architecture_grad_school_advice/e5rvzlr/).

If your professor gave you a list of programs to look into AND says that he'll write you a strong letter of rec, I think that you should definitely consider applying to at least some of them. If I didn't trust my PI and postdoc mentor when they told me I could get into the program I'm in right now, then I might not even have made it to grad school. Of course, survivorship bias is a thing, but my point is that when a PI says you have a chance, it doesn't seem like reducing that chance to zero by not applying is the best course of action. Rejection does suck. I only got one acceptance. One is all you need.

Perhaps you may be afraid that you will get rejected from every program again. While that might be discouraging, it's not the end of the world. Others are already offering you their help; if you put in your best effort and still don't get in, then there's nothing you should regret. Yes, it is important to be realistic about your odds. However, when we are anxious, we often fail to properly judge those odds. Right now, you have external validation from your PI, so I'd say run with it.

In addition, if your programs require a statement of purpose (I know my biology-related applications did), **take it seriously**, and I'd strongly encourage you to have trusted advisors look over it and point out any red flags. I personally believe that your letters + a quality, honest statement + your now increased research experience can play a huge role in overcoming a weaker GPA.

I don't have great tips for interviews. I got interviews at two programs and was rejected by one. All I can say is that, at the very least, you should have a strong understanding of the projects you have worked on and a good answer for why you should be in grad school.

If you're retaking the GRE, set aside a decent amount of time to study for it so that you don't have to worry about your score holding you back. Make sure you are aware of how adaptive difficulty works on the exam - simply taking standard practice tests might give you a false sense of security. Also, use official GRE prep material from ETS.

When experiencing anxiety in my senior year of undergrad (even after applications were sent in), I found it helpful to go to counseling. Even if you don't think your anxiety is that severe, I think that everyone can benefit from talking to a good counselor. Maybe also find some time to hang out with friends. :)

Yes. GRE for PhD programs is meant to differentiate between candidates when there are no other means to do so, it's fairly useless.

Sounds like you have improved on three of them since last year, and now even have last year's interview experiences to build upon. You are a much stronger candidate now.

I sat in on admission committee meetings and took notes on what the faculty said about the applicants.  When the letters went out, I always got calls and emails from applicants we'd turned down.  So yes, it's okay to ask, and you may get some useful advice.

The most reasonable approach I got was, is there anything you can tell me that might help me put together a stronger application next time around?  I would tell them what I could--like, the committee felt that your statement of purpose was a somewhat vague and your research interests weren't well-defined; or, your GPA or your GRE's just weren't competitive with the rest of our applicant pool; etc.  Sometimes, it wasn't so much about them--like, we got a very large number of applications this year in their sub-field, so the competition was especially tough for those spots; or the professor they wanted to work with has just announced her retirement, and isn't taking on any new students.  Sometimes I needed to soften the faculty's words a little bit (like with the guy who cited the chair of our admission committee extensively in his writing sample, but totally misunderstood her conclusions--I told him that his writing sample didn't go over well, but I didn't repeat the professor's exact words about it!)  I couldn't comment on the contents of a recommendation letter, but I could tell someone that theirs were too outdated, or that it would have been better if they'd all been academic and not from employers.  And yes, sometimes, I had to tell someone, don't bother re-applying here, because I just can't see us ever offering you admission--it's just not a good fit.

So ask them for some constructive feedback--briefly, politely, non-defensively.  If they say there's nothing they can tell you, accept it--some departments just don't answer those questions.  But don't feel bad for asking--it's a reasonable question.",1397075235,332

After doing so, you will realize that you are pretty damn lucky and that there are plenty of people who would sacrifice a lot to have just a fraction of what you have in terms of just your accomplishments and opportunities. I'm assuming you applied to reasonable schools that after your research and consideration you thought you had a really good shot at. Think of the people out there who only wish they could consider the schools that you considered. Think of those who only wish they could be in a situation/position to be applying to the schools that you applied too. 

Now be thankful.

Be thankful that after your ambitions failed to pan out, you still have alternatives and that you won't be poor and homeless on the street because there are people out there who are faced with that reality.

Rejection is hard to deal with. But you cannot think that you are defeated because you aren't. You've come too far to be defeated, and at the graduate level, rejection just isn't the appropriate word. For whatever reason, you just didn't fit well with the program just as others who may have had credentials superior to yours weren't a fit for the program either.

If you're plan is to make an impact in the world, you will do it whether it is through one avenue or another. Therefore, in the context of your situation, maybe your impact won't be through the PhD you wanted but it will be via something else and you need to change your trajectory to continue towards that plan. Don't consider it a ""Plan B"" or a ""Backup Plan"", because your plan is still the same. You just need to change your trajectory and you will realize the world of experiences and opportunities out there that you had no idea existed. If you're spiritual then have faith in the stars above that are maybe blessing you in disguise and opening your eyes to something for which you may have much more zeal. 

Get feedback if you can from the schools you didn't get accepted to and if you still think this is what you want to do, then better yourself and be steadfast in applying again. But do not think you're defeated because in the bigger picture of your life, your predicament at this moment is actually pretty trivial.

"Rejected, again",233lee,cgvq5f8,233lee,"Speaker(id: 'Zahanna', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","Hello Warlockhoney. I was in pretty much the same position as you. I applied directly out of undergrad and was rejected. I then applied last fall and just got rejected from the school I was waitlisted for -they did send a very nice email though, which was nice. The reason I'm still motivated to apply again, I created a list of 50 schools to research, is because of my view point. Rejections suck, but if you stay in the same rut year after year, you aren't going to improve your admissions chances. 

Now that you are not going into a PhD program this fall, you need to look at all the positives. You now have 6 months to try and figure out, even more, exactly what Master's program you want to apply for and what you want to do with a Master's program. If you can honestly say in your personal statement that you took time after your bachelors degree to discover your goals, and that you aren't just applying to the Master's program because you feel like you should but because it's the only program that will actually help propel you to your career of choice, you will look like an awesome go-getter. Something like; 

""My name is Warlockhoney, when I was first rejected from this program last year I initially felt a sense of failure and shame. I questioned my abilities and what my true motives were in applying. After the initial despondency, I reaffirmed my belief that I am a capable student and that my life goals and ambitions will best be served through a Master's program at Blah University. I am a proactive individual and although, I was disappointed with the delay in my plans I did not allow that disappointment to stop me from pursuing my goals. 
         Instead of starting a Master's program in the fall, I began volunteering at Blah Neuroscience Lab. I worked with Dr. Blah, and gained not only a great deal of experience but also further solidified my understanding of neuroscience and the work that is involved. I am re-applying to Blah University because the program matches with my research goals. I understand that admission is difficult, but I have over come many challenges in the past few years and they have only strengthened my resolve in obtaining a Master's and becoming a Neuro-scientist. My proactive attitude and life experiences will make me an asset to the Blah University Neuroscience team. I fully understand the workings of a laboratory setting and am confident that I will be able to contribute to the success of Blah Laboratory. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely Warlockhoney.""

Wa-Bam.

Also, there are other options besides a Master's degree to help you. Johns Hopkins offers Post-graduate certificate in Health Sciences. It's mainly used by kids who weren't able to get into the JHU master's program and want to boost their grades to get into medical school. They offer fellowships, but they are very difficult to get, so you'd have to expect to pay for it. It's 5 or 6 classes and would boost your GPA, hopefully, and show that you really are serious about higher education.

I almost cried for you OP!** I am in the same boat this year was year number two of rejection only. I am applying to Social Psychology PhD programs (conflict resolution and sustainable peace building). It is soul crushing. I am also having huge difficulty getting lab experience. Fuck life can be cruel. 

**However,** I look at the fact that I came from a town of 600 with a terrible Kansas education system and I graduated with honors and then graduated with a 3.65 from a private liberal arts university with no financial support and only the moral support of my grandfather in a family that looked down on my education (fundamentalist christian family and I am female). Then I say wow! I have come very far and I will land somewhere amidst the stars even if it is not where I would like. 

Oh, also I did this all while being treated for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (1st suicidal thoughts at age five and my mother is an addict with Narcissistic Personality Disorder). The treatments did not work as it turned out that the Depression and Anxiety was a result of the continued energy I exerted to achieve in spite of ADHD symptoms that I simply thought was just a lack of will power and my moral failing (thus god was angry with me and I was sinful...I am now an atheist to the anguish of my family...except my grandfather). I then made it through undergrad and earned a BA in psychology and English writing and a minor in history while working 40 hours a week and taking 16-21 credits and assisting with research (that was never published unfortunately) and during this time still did not have the correct diagnosis. I worked my ass off and slept like 4-6 hours a night for 4 out of the 5 years I was finishing my undergraduate degree. **Wow just typing that all out is exhausting**

Thanks to a perceptive and supportive SO I now have a diagnosis and Therapy and the correct medication. I have been suicidal thought free for about a year now. The first year since I was five years old. I am currently unemployed and focusing on getting research experience and better Quant. scores on the GRE. 

**I have also found Reddit to be a life saver for me. It has provided me with valuable advice and a place to share that is safe and allowed me to help others who struggle (that is what I want to do with my life and my PhD). Thank You Reddit and OP this too shall pass. A couple of quotes to think about:**

&gt; intellectual history of Near East

I know comparatively little about history and am not in history myself, but this seems like a boutique topic. I don't know whether the schools they are applying to have faculty who could realistically supervise such a dissertation, but if they're just spamming all the Ivies and Oxbridge because they're the Ivies and Oxbridge, then they probably haven't thought about program fit, like, at all.

Don't ask me because I don't know, but if you were to ask me about where to study such a topic, my intuition would be Middle Eastern Studies programs, not history programs.

&gt; The only guess is that the MA's thesis topic was significantly different from the proposed PhD research topic but it's unclear whether that would do them in.

Does that mean they don't actually have any experience studying the topic they want to study? For an applicant with an MA, that's concerning. Also, was their writing sample in the area they want to study?

I don't know if you don't know how PhD admissions works, or if they don't, but in your OP, you're not really focusing on the salient factors. A high GPA is nice, a well-ranked UC is nice, but what ultimately matters is your letters, sample, research statement, and fit.

1. The Fall 2017 application process was bad for history. Two top programs took fewer people than they had in prior years, and at least one mid-tier program I know of was unable to fund students. 

2. You're not referring to SoP/LoRs/Writing sample. Those are arguably the most important things. They need to be excellent, not just adequate. 

3. Language preparation? Do you know Arabic and hopefully one other non-European language? That can help a lot. 

4. Fit. You may be applying to programs for names alone and not because the faculty studies what you study. Trust me, I did this with Harvard; it was a poor decision. 

5. Finally, keep in mind the random nature of the process. Maybe you applied to work with people who were going on leave, retiring, or had taken graduate students in the prior year. Graduate admissions are not nearly as data-based as undergraduate- they're way more arbitrary.

The gap might be an issue, it could also be the letters themselves. Generally, it's recommended to get the strongest possible letters - while it would be better to have the most recent professor contacts if your friend, say, had very little interaction with one of the professors and they wrote a generic letter, that would likely be worse for the application than having a letter from an undergrad professor with whom your friend worked closely and had a stellar relationship. 

The proposal sounds exactly like where it should be. But it might be worth looking over - two rounds of rejections might indicate that there are some inherent flaws. 

The potential supervisors who were contacted - did they express interest in the project or simply agree that they would be a supervisor? Does their research line up (in some way) with your friend's interests and proposed project? I would contact the supervisor, personally, especially at the UK universities because the supervisor over here is instrumental in an application.

If you haven’t been rejected by EVERY ONE of the programs you applied to, there’s still hope. Some programs send out offers in the second round after their top tier candidates accept/reject their offers. 

I don’t know what your field is so I can’t exactly offer tailored advice. But speaking from my personal experience, (I’m a senior undergrad going for PhD programs in Economics, got my first offer three days ago from Ohio State) apply to as many programs as possible if money is not an issue. My theory is that applying for grad school is like drawing from a probability distribution; you’ll likely get more offers if you increase your sample size. Ask your professors about school choices and apply to two or three safe schools that you know you’ll most likely get in: for me, my department chair told me that he’ll be “very surprised” if OSU doesn’t take me, and he was right. I applied to 15 programs in total, including three MA programs. I had around 3 very reachy ones (ivy, etc), around 4 reach, 5-6 decent chance ones, and around 3 safety schools. 

GRE is definitely important but it’s only a screening device (at least for Econ). You only have to get a high enough score to make sure your application gets reviewed. For me, that means a high enough quant score or my application gets tossed into the trash. As other people have suggested, send your personal statement to your professors for suggestion. For PhD programs, you’ll want to make clear your research interests, prove that you know what you’re getting yourself into and that you have the necessary preparation to survive it, and talk about a professor at the school you’re applying to with whom you would be interested in working with. (From what I heard from my professors) Often if a candidate mentions a professor by name their application will get forwarded to that professor, and if he/she thinks the candidate is someone they’ll work well with then that’s an offer right there. 

Also if you have professors who know people/graduated from schools you’re applying to it doesn’t hurt to ask them to put in a good word either. ( of course you have to be close to them and they have to like you)",1517354905,386

My advice: If you do get rejected by all, take a week or two to grieve. Go on some hikes, get active, and love yourself. Accepting that depression as a part of you is the first step to mastering it, and then you can get to work. Make sure to notify your recommenders quickly, and express your willingness to try again.

I volunteered at, then was hired on to, a chemical engineering group. I had one published paper from a while back, but the active lab experience was the bigger factor. I could finally demonstrate that I would be a valuable asset to a graduate program.

I made an effort to reach out to other professors than I had previously, professors outside of my field who could speak to my character and research acumen. Being afraid of 'using the wrong professors' slowed down my search the first time, and left my recommenders with little time to properly write.

Finally, I actively called graduate programs and asked questions about their structure, their focuses, and for recommendations on where to look for specific approaches. I realized that I didn't need to know exactly what I would spend the next 6 years of my life on to write a personal statement. I wrote about a passion for **one possible project that could occupy my phd** and the ways that project intersected with the university.

I declined the acceptance and went into industry instead. The program didn’t seem like a perfect fit, and I was having a rough time personally. I spent a year and a half in industry before applying again. I only applied to 2 PhD programs that round, too, except for they were higher caliber than my previous round. I was rejected from one faster than I’d ever been rejected from anywhere. But accepted to the other one with full funding (great funding I am eternally grateful for, to be honest) and I’m happy and successful in my second semester. 

My GRE scores were above average for writing and verbal but horrendous for quant. But I never took the GRE again. It was a terrible experience, and not something I ever wanted to relive. What I did do was 1) get an MS before getting a PhD, 2) way more research on the universities with each round, 3) gain industry experience (2.5 years total by the time I started my PhD), 4) open my prospects to different but related majors, and 5) and as another poster said, a complete overhaul of my personal statement, which reflected my true desire and research interests in obtaining a PhD rather than the typical “this is the next step of life” that can sometimes come off in a personal statement.

Imagine a 22 year old crying like a kid who got injured. I mean it's just human. My only saving grace was that I got wait listed by UMich which is very good for Aerospace. I didn't get in the end but it was the only reason I didn't say fuck all and quit as a great program had an inkling of demand for me.

Take time to evaluate yourself. Check your scores, grades and compare with gradcafe. Use common sense as each case is different but it's kind of a litmus test. Note that what your professors say might be outdated. In fact they told me to apply to MIT and Caltech lol.. Whereas I didn't even get into WUSTL which is ranked in the 50+ for aerospace. My scores were average for top programs. V/Q/W-155/165/4.5. I doubt that was the reason I got rejected. My friend got into Harvard for Physics with 160 Q. Physics mind you! Once you reach a threshold score, I feel they don't care. I might be wrong on this but try and improve your score if you think you need improvement.

So I took stock of my position and concluded that: I didn't reach out to professors enough before applying, I didn't show confidence in my personal statement, was confused of my research goals and didn't have enough technical skills. So I devised a plan. I took my programming books and took online courses to bolster my resume, got advise on my statement from people who got into schools, portrayed a more confident me and last but not least, spam professors. I thought they weren't going to respond but some emailed me back months later! I got one reply 2 months after sending an email encouraging me to apply. This is very important. Don't skip this step. 

I applied to UIUC for spring and was accepted to the MS program. It has a great aerospace program and it would be ranked 4th in my list of schools I ever applied to. I was not given a research advisor as it was spring admissions but a professor contacted me after reading my essay regarding a possible project for which I didn't make the cut ,as an older student was selected, but he said he will keep an eye out for me. I am currently happy being busy with coursework and no sleep as it beats having no work any day. I hope you find your happiness too! Retake your GRE if you are insecure about your score.

About 1/3 responded (so like, 2 or 3 out of 7 or so?). 

however, unless you are way out of your league (which it appears you are not) you are not likely to get particularly helpful answers because they will probably just say, predictably, ""it's a question of fit.""

this isn't however as cryptic as it seems. What they are looking for is the fit between your research and theirs. which comes out in ways like- would you be able to teach one of their classes as their TA?

so fit DOESNT mean topic. What it means is what Paradigm, Methods, and Theory do you use and what kind of questions do you care about. 

So you could be very qualified etc but if you are a writing your research statemtn from a postpositivist research paradigm adn your projected advisor is an interpretivist or criticalist, it aint gonna happen for ya. 

and useful way to actually figure this kind of stuff out is after reading your potential advisor's papers, look especially at their Lit Reviews and bibliographies. Who are they citing? which debates are they speaking to? What are those people known for saying? 

so even thinking that you align with yoru professor on 'inequality in black urban schools in northeast USA with large TFA numbers in the teaching ranks"" is not really that important. Much more important would be: OK, im interested in an interpretivist ethnographic approach to understanding how teachers think about their students lives outside of school"" 

All these kinds of frameworks will come through in how you draft your statement of purpose - which, i think - is little more than an opportunity to show you can draft a good research question/proposal. 

One last thing: apply to get into conferences now. Most conferences honestly have REALLY LOW cut offs to get in. I mean, you might not get on the panel with the top dogs in the field, but almost always you'll get in somewhere if you have something coherent. These are great ways to present your interests, get feedback, get something on your cv, meet potential advisors, and talk to current students about their programs and what might get you in. buying someone a coffee really might be the only thing between you and taking a peek behind the curtain. 

and FINALLY, im not suggesting doing anything unethical whatsoever, but as it stands now, you dont have to answer to an IRB. so i say get out there and start trying out some preliminary pilot research wherever you can. learning from experience is irreplaceable. and when you get to grad school, youll already have projects going and ideas forming, which will hlep you write papers and choose courses. 

most of all, dont get down. if someone as dumb as me can get in somewhere good, im pretty sure just about anyone could.

While I won't go into great detail about coping strategies (as others have answered this), I'd like to share with you my insight that might help him, should he want to apply to PhD programs again next year.

I am an admissions consultant (80% undergrad, 20% grad school) and worked in a top 10 undergrad university admissions office, evaluating apps. You wouldn't believe the marginal differences between applicants that were great but still denied and applicants who were accepted. Often, had they done one thing slightly different (for undergrads, it's often major selection), they would have been accepted. 

I've worked with grad applicants who were denied everywhere the year before, took all the same experiences and packaged themselves slightly differently the next year, only to be accepted into their dream programs. 

If he ultimately decides to apply to PhD programs once again, he knows his next step: gain more experience in the field. And, in that year, he should reach out to professors at his desired institutions and cultivate relationships with them, subtly picking up pointers on his own application, the type of students with whom they want to work, etc. He might benefit by looking up (on LinkedIn or department websites) the type of students who WERE accepted to those programs, and drawing some conclusions about the qualities to which that university might have been drawn in the application process. He should then reevaluate his own experiences, seeing if he can repackage himself in any way to reflect these new ideals.

A few years ago I had a client who was waitlisted at the top business schools. I happened to find the contact information of her top choice's dean of students and helped her craft an email to reach out. The response was immediate: ""thanks for your interest, but I have nothing to do with admissions decisions."" My client came back to me, dejected that her efforts hadn't been successful. I told her to go back to that same person and say, ""Thanks, but I would still love to speak with you."" And it worked. The dean said okay, they had an incredibly productive conversation, and my client picked up hints regarding the ideal applicant, the spirit of the program, the qualifications necessary to succeed, etc. She then turned back to admissions and crafted an incredible email, citing her meeting with the dean, applying the things she learned to herself and her skills, and repacking herself as the perfect applicant that she KNEW the university wanted. She was accepted off the waitlist the very next day.

I recommend he follow a similar strategy for next year's apps. Have him get in front of as many people from those universities (deans, professors, admissions folks, current students, alumni, etc.) and figure out what they are looking for and how he can repackage what wonderful skills and experiences he has to be exactly what they are looking for.

Let me know if any of my points need clarification. Happy to answer more questions.",1488305510,511

A PhD isn't like a professional master's program.

A PhD applicant can't just ""repackage"" themselves from a medieval English specialist to a 20th century American specialist because that's the time period that the department happens to be accepting students in this year. You can't just say you want to study x - you have to show with evidence that you are able to successfully research x on a high level, ideally with more than your writing sample. Moreover, what you research in grad school determines where your career goes, and at the initial stage, what classes you take, what people you work with, etc. PhD application packages are pretty involved, and if there are any fit issues, they usually go deeper than can be resolved with a single email: conflicts of methodology, critical stance, coherence with existing literature, etc.

Like I said, in a general sense, being proactive, viewing your materials from the point of view of the admissions committee as well as your own, seeking insider knowledge are all good strategies.

My advice is that if you don't get what you want, it is not the end of the world (as much as it may feel like it for a while).  Re-apply and get exactly what you want.

Don't give up.

It only takes one admission, just one, to change everything. Graduate applications, in part, is a probabilities game. Do your best to put together the best application, and send it to as many places as you are able to, given your time and budget constraints.

Get your SOP reviewed, and work on it as much as you can to make it stellar. Broaden your horizons and considered other universities that you may apply to, even abroad. 

If you're applying to the top of the top universities, consider 2nd tier ones which are equally as good, but have rolling admissions or less competition.

"Interviewed and rejected last year, same deal this round of applications",2sxscs,cntu9hm,2sxscs,"Speaker(id: 'MrLegilimens', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","My interview weekend was very laid back, in the sense that the 8 professors who interviewed me, perhaps 1 to 2 of them asked me what I was interested in studying. I got into a discussion with one of them about the idea of power and how the Olympics play into the global identity of world powers. I told another professor that I thought their research was missing the point of what culture was (politely of course) and they agreed and discussed with me my theoretical idea of culture (which she also knew from the literature).

And yes, the program director was just very blunt and asked if I had any questions.

I think the point is, in some interviews, they don't want to know about you. They want to know that you can think. Yes, you made the short list. But can you stand out? 

I don't think it's a good idea to read up on everyone's most recent papers and try and discuss them with them. Maybe, but you'll probably make a mistake and look like a jackass. Get an idea of what they study (faculty bios works)and try and slightly modify your elevator pitch of your interests to brush over theirs. 

For example, if I was studying --- idk, Psych guy here, so ... Intergroup Conflict --- and I had to talk with a Neuroscientist about it, I'd probably say I was interested in Intergroup conflict and what conditions can trigger some individuals to shrug off a drawing of Muhammad while the same image can cause others to shoot up a magazine. Because obviously there are similar neurons firing when they both process the same image, but there must be a difference in brains as well for the actions to differ? But then I'd wait to see what they said, and then counter with my theoretical position that losing the person through the neuron connections is a very bad thing, and that in the end it is the person, not the neurons, doing the action.

Read the news before you go. Current events (and knowledge of them, and how they are interesting within your field) is huge. 

Also, know that you're always being interviewed, even when you're not. You're being judged always, so don't be a dick. Don't be weird. 

Oh, and questions for program director:
1) Do you offer funding for the summer?
2) How does funding work?

If you're interviewing with people you aren't interested in working with my hunch is that you've applied to a rotations based PhD program. Have you directly contacted the people you are interested in working with? See, what can happen is that when they organize these weekends, some professors may not be available. In my program it could be like pulling teeth to get professors to fess up to their availability on interview days. This meant that while they might be taking students the following year, interviewees might not have met with them during interview weekends (hopefully that all makes sense). The people you are likely meeting with are a mixture of the admissions committee and people they at least hoped you be interested in talking to. If there are specific people you are interested in working with (and in biology, you should be interested in specific people before even applying), contact them ahead of time and see if they will have time to meet with you during either the official interview weekend, or even on your own. 

Being an introvert. I am too. It can be hard when doing interview weekends like this. You don't have to be familiar with everything everyone does though to make a good impression. There are still questions you can ask that will help show people that you are a good fit as a grad student (assuming you are). If the interviewer leads off talking about their own research, ask them general questions. What made you decide to focus on this area of research? What do you think is the biggest challenge your type of research is facing right now. Where do you hope to see your research in 5 years, 10 years, etc? Some of the more interesting interviews I did were with people who knew I had no interest in their research and they weren't familiar with my subfield. But I learned some really interesting things and had some great conversations.

I just wanted to add that I've heard from former faculty that this year has been almost unprecedentedly difficult for applicants in my field, and I've heard that my peers in English and comp lit aren't faring much better. We have a glut of qualified students hoping for academic careers (or at least reprieve from the job market) and the funding for students and the jobs they would eventually fill just don't seem to be there.

In my case, my numbers and letters were rock-solid: the only uncertain elements of my applications were my choice of writing samples and my statements of purpose. I keep hearing that this year it all boils down to fit, and I'm something of an oddball in my field. I've got options in more heterodox programs, but nothing quite certain yet. The schools I've been told for years I'd get to choose from have mostly turned me down. 

This is to say that I hope no one is coming out of this application season too discouraged. The platitudes in rejection letters about all the qualified students that were turned down probably aren't just platitudes.

I'm working in another field in what I thought would be a single gap year, and worst case scenario I scrape by for another year as the ""scholarly activity"" section of my CV magically transforms into published work. There are options out there for staying active intellectually, and added time and work makes for stronger applications.

Ultimately I was able to prove myself as a viable candidate for the program. In their eyes they are taking a risk but they saw that I went to great lengths to prove that I can do it.

Do some analysis and maybe get an opinion from someone who will be honest with you if you applied to programs far outside your reach based on GPA/experience/GRE. 

As for options:

1. Start applying to a ton of jobs in industry. They are less likely to care so much about GPA, although plenty do have hard cutoffs.

2. Analyze your connections and who they could possibly put you in contact with in industry or academia. Don't be afraid to take advantage of connections! (in a positive advantage sense, not advocating anything creepy...)

3. Try to get more research experience by taking a job as a low wage lab tech somewhere. Your home lab if your PI is well funded may even be an option. If you can become a coauthor on a paper by the time application due dates roll around next year I think it would help a lot.

4. Retake undergrad classes to remedy GPA or maybe also take some grad classes at your home institution if possible to gain new knowledge as well. This is almost certainly the most expensive option and may not even be a possibility.

This falls below pretty much every schools minimum GPA. And by minimum, I mean that the graduate school at most schools cannot accept a candidate with a GPA below a certain level, usually in the 2.8-3.2 range no matter how much research experience or how decent the GRE scores are. At the school I am on admissions for we have absolutely no recourse for admitting a candidate with a GPA below 3.0. Presently, our admission are based on a combination of GRE * GPA and we move down the list and because admission is so competitive at the moment we rarely consider GPAs below a 3.2 to 3.4 range as we have numerous candidates with strong GRE scores, strong GPAs and strong research experience.

If you have not graduated yet, I would strongly urge you to stay in school, get a minor in a related field or a second major in a related field and get you GPA above 3.2 at all costs, ideally above 3.5. You should be able to do this in 2 years. No school cares how many years you were in school for a BS/BA, but they do care what your GPA is.

If you can, try and bankrupt your first two years that are dragging your GPA down. Yes, you lose money, but some schools will let you bankrupt a semester or two and it disappears. But you have to retake the courses. Study like made if this is an option. And by study like mad, I mean treat it like a full time job. If not, re-take the courses and replace the grades. Most schools allow for this. Yes it takes longer to get your BS/BA and costs money, but it is well spent if grad school is for you.

If you have graduated, then you need to find another university that will allow you to get a second BS/BA in a related field and you need to ace every course so your GPA is above 3.2, ideally above 3.5. Some will take transfer credit from an existing BS/BA.

Otherwise, you need to become a tech somewhere and hope that your experience after 2-3 years will make up for a low GPA. Very few programs will consider this, but some programs will. Even better if you can tech at a university that will allow you to enroll for grad credit and get part of, or all of your MS by paying for it or at least get a GPA history as a grad student that is &gt;3.2 , ideally &gt;3.5.

Just like for undergrad where schools have minimum requirements, the graduate school will have the same.

Exceptions can be made, but it is not a good idea to rely on this. Our graduate school can make exceptions in about 1% of the admitted students.

If nothing else, they may let you take classes without being enrolled in the degree program, if you show improvement, you can then apply for enrollment.

For an academic program, they want to hear from academics - an old prof or someone who can comment on your ability to succeed in grad school. This is especially important for an online program where it's very self driven and needs serious discipline. Get in touch with your old teachers you did well with, or take a class in the meantime and kick ass. Also how many ppl read your app letter(not just proofread)? Get feedback, show it to everyone, especially other grad students and teachers. 

Just an FYI, I applied to 6 masters programs, got accepted to 2.

"Understanding why I was rejected, open to advice",1a9yl3,c8vfs20,1a9yl3,"Speaker(id: 'littlechicken920', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","Don't listen to adversedeviant.  I've reviewed over 10,000 applications, and I can tell you that I just glance at the GPA.  Letters of recommendation and statement of purpose is what I really look at.  And the new GRE scores.  The new GRE test is a much better test of how well you will perform in Grad school.  So I do put more weight on the test now.


There are a number of reasons why you may have been rejected.  Did you apply to the program early?  Online programs sometimes have a specific number of slots available to fill.  If you applied a little late those slots might have already been filled.  


Is this a really popular program?  I've worked for an extremely popular program.  We got thousands of applications to fill about a hundred spots.  In the end, a lot of amazing applicants had to be denied.  So getting a denial doesn't mean you have hit a dead end.


Is there a similar program available at another school?  There are lots of accredited online programs out there.  And since it's online, you aren't limited to schools in a certain area.  


Also, I think it's great that you are doing a course as a non-degree student.  That's a great way to prove yourself and get yourself noticed.  Many students that are coming back to school after several years in industry start as a non-degree.  And it works perfectly because it will allow you to see if you actually enjoy the work and want to get a MS.  And if you can manage your time with your full-time job.  And it lets the school see how you do, sorta like a trial run.


Don't abandon a career you love just because you got denied from one school.  I know you are bummed right now, but saying that you have to totally change careers because of one denial is a little dramatic.  There are other schools and other opportunities.  Have you talked to your boss about wanting to advance?  Maybe they have some advice or could help you get there?  ",1363264315,347

If you are going for English, management, etc, the verbal score will be more important.  


The written score is always important though.  Graduate students need to know how to write clearly for their thesis and journal articles.  So the writing score is always important.


I would say that 160-170 is phenomenal. 140-150 is very average.  Anything below that and you might want to take the test again, unless you have something else up your sleeve.

I am aware that there were many applicants to the program with high qualifications.  I do believe that I was a strong candidate for admission but there were some definite weaknesses in my application.  I was wondering if you could give me any feedback as to what parts of my application I could best strengthen to improve my chances of admission for the future?  I understand that not having a BS in CS severely hurts my application to premiere programs such as yours and I was wondering, in particular, if taking the time to get a masters degree would benefit my application.

Thank you again,

Andrewff

Reversing a rejection with an email?

The only things I might mention to strengthen my application would be new publications, conference presentations or funding.

Honestly, I wouldn't send a follow up challenging your rejection, especially if it's a ""tear-jerking masterpiece."" Unless you do it right, you may end up sounding like a whiny snowflake and if you apply in the future, the graduate coordinator may remember you that way - hurting your chances in the future.

I've never heard of anyone doing it, which doesn't mean it wouldn't work, but keep in mind that they are admitting students based on what sort of funding is available. Once their incoming class is confirmed, there isn't a lot of wiggle room there, which is why it *might* work if you have secured your own funding.

As others have said, you should instead email to ask how you can improve your application for next year instead.",1361296788,160

You can think of the statement of purpose as a set of bulletpoints that cover who you are in ways your transcripts cannot. 

The intro paragraph should tell the reviewers that you are interested in their program for x, y, z reasons in a way that shows you understand their department. You should say so at the very top and then go into a metaphor or whatever device you think works for your document. 

Subsequent paragraphs should then get into your work, with individual paragraphs covering specific projects or labs if your experience is extensive. Start with overall goal, the hypothesis, and approach. Then talk about your role and what you learned from the experience for each paragraph. 

The final paragraph should go back full-circle and restate the main point in your intro paragraph, BUT with additional details that delve into specific labs and potential projects. This is where communicating prior to applying helps. Getting this information will make you stand out because you talk about specifics that 90% of applicants skip. 

As such, you will have a ""skeleton"" document that is the same for the middle paragraphs but varies for the intro and final paragraphs. I'm sure you employ your own system, but I found this method to be most efficient in my process for applying to many schools while personalizing the content.

I'd be surprised if it was the #1 factor keeping you out of programs (with funding).

I think your suspicions are probably pointing you in the right direction. I don't know what your application looks like, but if you are applying to a ""Variety"" of programs, your SOP might have shown (in some way) that you lack the focus to succeed in a particular program. 

Let's hypothetically say that you used only one SOP to apply widely. This isn't an effective strategy, mainly because each discipline has their own jargon and things they expect you to talk about/ways to approach research. If you only used one SOP, it probably turned a lot of programs off--because you're not speaking to them directly.

Without knowing more about your applications as a whole, it's hard to tell where the actual problem lies. 

Something I might suggest is looking into funded Masters programs (perhaps in something like GIS, where you can evaluate land use change) and give yourself some time to figure out if you're more interested in urban planning, geography, sociology--whatever interests you.

It sounds like you instead of questioning ""How"", you really need to start questioning ""Why"". Make an effort to really learn about the projects that you are working on and where they fit into the bigger research field and the direction that its headed. Read as many paper as you can by your PI and others in the field. In each paper, try to identify why the research is being done: What questions are they trying to answer and what pushed them in that direction? What further questions does this research raise and what is the next step? Write these things down and make connections between papers that you read. The more you read the easier this will be to do, and the more questions will arise. If you come up with any particularly interesting ones, discuss them with researchers in your lab, or email the authors and start dialogues with them. Take the questions, and try to think of how you might go about answering them.

And depending on your role in the lab and your relationship with the PI, discuss your goals and see if it would be possible for you to head up your own small project. Take one of those questions and design a small project around it and propose it to your PI. If he doesn't bite or doesn't want you diverting your attentions from your tech work, you might suggest just working on it in your free time with his advisement, or you might look for somebody else to work with.

Admissions counselors for graduate programs, top, mid, and lower tier, advise having a 'strong' GPA to increase admission chances. GPA is only one component of an application, but if an applicant has a 3.5 or above, then they may be given consideration for a program over others. Of course, this doesn't apply for all schools. You would be hard pressed to find someone applying to a tier one school with a 3.5, unless the rest of their application was extraordinary.

A GPA and a GRE/GMAT combination can make or break your application. Forget about the average GPA of the candidates--it's an easily derivable statistic that barely scratches the surface of the accepted applicant pool. If you don't have a solid GPA and GRE/GMAT combination, your chances of being accepted decrease significantly, regardless of whether or not you're above the average accepted scores of a class.

Furthermore, the other parts of the application, such as letters of recommendation and line items on your resume, are taken into consideration after the 'thinning' of the original herd (i.e. removing all applicants who didn't fit the criteria, unless something else stood out to counselors). Experience related to your field during the gap between undergraduate -- graduate can enhance your application. Unrelated experience or too many gap years can hinder your chances.

Point being, admissions are calculated very carefully and relying upon base statistics to gauge your chance of admission is unreliable. Applicants with lower stats than listed have been accepted with scholarship and applicants with 'dream' stats have been denied admission. Graduate programs want people who can positively contribute to their program--applicants are not merely numbers, although those count, too. There might have been something that another applicant could have contributed to the program that you couldn't have--racial makeup not included.

"How does “rejected for phd, but accepted for masters” works?",9p6a02,e7zkbrj,9p6a02,"Speaker(id: 'PurrPrinThom', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({}))","When that happens (in my experience, and I'm sure it can vary) it's not that the applicant applied for both a master's and a PhD, it's that the department felt like the candidate wasn't strong enough for a PhD program but would still be a beneficial addition to the department. 

In some cases, this is a soft acceptance: if you complete the master's, there's essentially a place for you in the PhD program once you're done. In other places, this is a soft rejection: they don't think you're good enough for their program and have offered the master's almost like a consolation prize. Sometimes the offer will be funded, which is a good indication that they do want you, and other times it won't be, which is *sometimes* an indication that they don't - but that varies widely by country, field and to an extent the department itself, and whether or not they have the money to fund master's students at all. 

As for your final question, I expect that you'll get a mixed response but I would err on the side of not signalling that. Personally, I don't think you should give any committee any reason to doubt you, or question your dedication. A PhD is a difficult undertaking, and you won't be accepted if they question your ability to complete it. I think that saying ""yeah I'd be fine with a master's too"" would make them question whether or not you really *want* the PhD. 

If they're a department that offers the option of rejected for PhD accepted for master's, then they're going to do that if they like you and reject you for the PhD, regardless of what you send to them. ",1539850050,285

I was most likely passed off to MAPSS because I only spoke two languages (I later found out that the minimum was three languages), my GRE score wasn't so hot because I suck at high level math, and I hadn't done a Bachelors thesis, so I didn't have longterm research experience. I was offered 1/3rd funding and I negotiated up to 1/2. I also wanted to be a TA, but I was told that Masters students are never TAs except for undergrad foreign language classes. I ended up doing MAPSS to get my foot in the door with a heavy hitting graduate school and I did well and came out with a thesis that could be prepared for publishing and three letters of recc. I will say that terminal Master programs like MAPSS are best if you plan on going for a PhD later. It helps prepare you for graduate school life. But there is also the chance that you decide that you don't want to go on for a PhD, which is the decision that the majority of terminal Master graduates at the University of Chicago reach. If you're not sure if you want a PhD, I wouldn't recommend a terminal Masters program. I was told that my Masters degree was very valuable and that I'd be able to get a great job with it. The only jobs I've been able to get are ones using my Bachelors degree and I currently make less than $14k a year despite having a Masters degree. The job market has changed and Masters degrees aren't really desired in many fields because employers don't want to pay for them. I don't mean to scare you away from the idea, but I also want to share my experience because MAPSS does a very good job of bending the truth to make it seem better than it actually is.

The program could also could be accepting less students due to a high yield previously, regardless of whether or not you are wanted by a professor. Or you could be so good that they didn't want to give you an acceptance as they thought you would be snatched up by a higher program. Maybe there was a subconscious bias if you are not a white male, or conversely, if you are, that they chose someone else other than you to increase the diversity of the program.

I was in a similar situation, where I applied to 10 schools and only got admitted to one school, at which point I wondered why I even applied to that school.

In the year after that, I spent a long time thinking about whether I wanted to go to grad school, what exactly I wanted to study, and what I hoped to get out of it. Once I could answer those questions for myself, I found that re-writing my statement of purpose from scratch was a breeze (had a pretty decent SOP after 3 drafts, as opposed to the 12 drafts I needed for the abysmal first-time applying) and I got accepted into 2 of the 3 programs I applied to.

For all those who are disheartened by rejection letters, if you think you might still be interested in pursuing grad school, take a week or two to evaluate if grad school is for you at this time in your life, what you can do to improve your application (it won't eat up a big chunk of your time), and how you can learn some skills in the meantime to make your experience at grad school a lot more meaningful.

The difference a year of introspection, effort and self-improvement makes is enormous. It shines through your application and will help you identify and be better prepared for grad programs that you are interested in. This is evidenced by OP's case as well. (Just make sure you start working on it soon after you've heard back from your last school this time around, otherwise, you'll lose the motivation quickly and might end up putting it off until a month before the application deadline. By working on it soon after, it will also give you a better idea of what you need to focus on during the rest of the year).

As I am sure you know, clinical psych is comically hard to get into, and it's even harder straight out of undergrad. In my cohort of 6, one of us came from undergrad. 

100% re-take the GRE. I think you are way underestimating how much math you are going to need in psych. It is not an afterthought at all. I'm a bit biased since I am working on a specialization, but after I'm done I am planning to have done my intro stats sequence, my multiple regression sequence, my HLM sequence, my SEM sequence, at least an intro item response theory course, at least some of a data science/programming in R sequence, hopefully a class focusing on stats for program eval, and hopefully a bayesian stats class that doesn't exist yet but that I am working to create in conjunction with some computer science folks. Some programs may let you skate a tiny bit more on stats but they're still going to expect you to have real solid math skills. 

Also 100% apply to WAY more than 6 schools, haha. And just since you did not mention-- make sure that you are applying to schools where you have a VERY strong research match with faculty, regardless of how ""fancy"" the name on the school is. 

I am also curious if you have any sort of clinical experiences, since you mentioned being light on work experience, I am curious how targeted your applications were, and I am curious if you got any interviews, since you did not mention that. 

The last thing I will say is that there is no such thing as skating into a clinical psych program. People are ridiculously qualified.

Applications get rejected because of the darndest things, like a single document misplaced by the graduate school, another applicant who studied under, (and has a recommendation from) their current POI 's ex-PhD student.... basically things you can't control. 

I don't know what happens in your field, but I got rejected by a top school because the profs I wrote about in my SOP didn't have funding. I'd email those professors prior to application but the departmental website specifically forbids talking to faculty until admitted. When I asked why I was rejected the DGS replied ""its probably our loss but if we admit you we may not be able to find you an adviser, which would put you in a difficult position"".

The reason I'm saying all this is, don't take rejections personally. ""Not being a food fit"" for a specific department doesn't mean being a universal misfit. You said no publications?

Your GPA is pretty low. Not terrible, but it isn't doing you any favors. You mentioned this as one of your strengths, but honestly, I see it more as a weakness. Also, having no coursework in psychology is a HUGE problem. Do you at least have any coursework in the sciences? How is anybody supposed to gauge your competence in psychology/science? 

If you took no psychology coursework, and your current job is not related to psychology, who is writing your rec letters? Research experience is an unspoken requirement. You need someone to vouch for your capabilities in your chosen field. 

Overall, you have some serious weaknesses: 1) no relevant experience in psychology 2) no relevant coursework in psychology 3) nobody in psychology that can vouch for your ability 4) low GRE scores. You can't build up a strong background in psychology in a few months. Research experience takes a while, building relationships with psychology professors takes a while, taking relevant coursework takes a while, and retaking the GRE will take a bit. If you really want to get into a graduate program, you need more time, maybe a year at least, to build up solid credentials. This probably isn't what you want to hear, but you have almost nothing going for you right now. 

Edit: Others have suggested doing more volunteer work or professional work since that better aligns with program requirements for a masters in counseling. I agree, and that probably should be higher on your priority list OP. But having research experience is always good and helps you stand out. Many other applicants will have that experience, so to be competitive, you should at least consider doing the same. ",1521753776,288

And if I may ask, what subfield of psychology is your friend getting a master's in &amp; how did they get there? 
 
Counseling appeals to me because I'm passionate about mental healthcare and about helping people work through their problems and I think it would bring me a lot of fulfillment (sounds trite/naïve but I have some personal experience w/ group therapy and think I would really thrive if I could facilitate the same type of growth for others as I experienced being offered to me. I understand that being on the receiving end of a service is not the same as providing it, but nevertheless...) Basically, I want to be able to effect positive change in people's lives through mental healthcare. I'd be interested specifically in working with young adults, as well as in spreading awareness of mental illness -- so potentially partnering with a nonprofit etc. And I guess there are other roads to that besides getting a master's in counseling, but I'm not exactly sure how to get there through another avenue, especially while doing something completely unrelated (to any field) currently. 

Perhaps a postbacc in psychology might make the most sense for me to start to be more competitive for psych grad programs of any variety as well as narrow my psych focus, but time is starting to feel really, really of the essence (I'm 25 and just spent three or four months waiting on a program that rejected me and was foolishly inactive in moving forward my career during that time, and I do, at some point in the *relatively* not far off future, want to have a family). I'm very worried about the time (and monetary) cost of investing in additional courses that are still just a preamble to the next step of my degree (especially with my family and my albeit very supportive partner looking for some concrete action steps in my career development at this point). Then again, if as it stands now I have basically no chance of getting into a psych master's program, a postbacc or serious commitment to beefing up my academic record may be my *only* option if I want to move forward with psych. 

I am really wishing for a networking opportunity right about now as I have a lot of questions about my career options and it can be quite embarrassing/demoralizing to reach out for guidance in a field that you've got no footing in. I just know that this is really what I want to do.

I kinda feel like it might be wise to take a couple days and explore to see if there are other roads? You have the same motivation as a lot of people who decide they want to go into psych--""psychology helped me so now I want to do it""--and it's not an invalid starting point, but I think you need more than that really general interest. So maybe counseling is your thing, but it also sounds like there could be a fulfilling career for you in a different but related role. You don't know because you haven't looked. If you find something where the path forward is clearer, it could save you some of the time and money you're worried about.

Getting the right prerequisites for your application saves time and money too--if you're gonna pay for an application, make it a good one. I understand not wanting to take unnecessary steps (money doesn't grow on trees), but this is probably a necessary step. 

If you do take extra classes, pursue a master's, and finish at age 28, it's not like you'll be ancient and way past the time for a career change. Plenty of people are just getting around to starting their ""real"" career at that age. 

As for networking, I would email psychology faculty right now at your alma mater, *very* briefly explain that you don't have a psych background, and ask if you could meet up with them to ask a few questions about the field and graduate school.

And yes, unfortunately as the other responses said your marks are pretty low. A lot of grad schools (especially the good ones) won't even seriously consider an application at less than a 3.4-3.6.

Second, put together some presentations and submit them to professional conferences (APA, Eastern Psych, etc etc, I'm sure there are tons). Then, if you have decent stuff, you'll get in. Go to the conferences and present your research. These conferences are, perhaps primarily, networking opportunities.

Research is very important for STEM PhD applicants, but most humanities applicants don't have the opportunity to do a remotely similar kind of research (lab work, publications, etc.) in undergrad, and tons of master's programs aren't research-centric at all.

And PhD applicants should all write about potential advisors/faculty whose work they're interested in, since you'll be pursuing a specialized research interest under the guidance of that advisor, but it isn't by any means a requirement for all master's apps.

I agree. Part of my purpose was to give the OP an opportunity to make good on their claim that they really do feel like they have a knack for it.

2.667 &lt; 2.8 tho

GPA requirements are a frustrating hurdle, but when you have a below-required GPA, you have to do some extra prep. Did you contact the department before applying to discuss your GPA? At worst, they would've told you not to bother and you could've made other plans in advance, rather than after receiving an inevitable decision. At best, they could've told you how to fix it. The sidebar post about getting into grad school with a sub 3 GPA is generally helpful, but what the most effective thing for you personally to do will depend on your field, the programs you're applying to, and even on you. Some programs will tell you to take some specific classes to show that you can handle the work, some will ask for more research or work experience, and some will just tell you that they don't accept people with a GPA like yours no matter what. Sometimes people - admissions officers, professors - will go out of their way to help you, just because you reached out. But you do need to reach out. This is a good idea in general, but especially when you're a candidate with a GPA below cutoff. You can't just expect things to work themselves out in life.

&gt; This program didn’t require them but said they’ll take them if GPA didn’t mean requirement

So... the program website spelled out in black and white what you needed to do if your GPA didn't meet requirements, and you didn't do it? *And you're asking what you should do????* OP, I don't even care if I get banned for this: are you trolling or stupid?",1525451864,279

This really isn't an excuse. If you're an adult capable of doing college-level work, you are capable of following basic directions like ""if your GPA is below 3.0, take the GRE"". Fundamentally, I don't care: the only person who suffers from your stupid mistakes is you. If you continue not following simple directions, this will continue to happen.

Research builds two very important things: connections and **provable experience.**

My advice? Do research, make sure to contact institutions to ask about what you can do better, and build a story for your application. My story focused on perseverance and extracting broadly useful skills from unique experiences. Yours might be totally different. Just make sure that your application **sells you**, not just reports on you.

Make sure you maintain good relationships with your advisers and other professors, explain your plan to them and don't be afraid to ask for advice and their help.

If so, talk to supervisors you are interested in working with. If they like you, application sometimes becomes a formality.

A personal email from your past supervisors to potential future supervisors could go a long way. I know it might not sound fair, but this is how several students I know, including me, got PhD positions. Our supervisors asked around and made sure the schools knew we were applying. A lot of professors get tons of emails from students so they almost always ignore them. At least, my supervisor did. I say you should attend some conferences in your field and talk to them face-to-face. It worked for people I know.
